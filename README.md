It is said that all people on average are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other. This React Web App helps you find the degree of separation between any two people.

Think of it as selecting two users on Facebook and trying to see how these two people are connected.

For example, if you have the following relationships added into your system...
1. Sameer is a Friend of Aayushi
2. Aayushi is a Friend of Bhaskar
3. Sameer is a Friend of Kamalnath Sharma
4. Kamalnath Sharma is a Friend of Shanti Kumar Saha
5. Shanti Kumar Saha is a Friend of Bhaskar

If you select two people, letâ€™s say Sameer and Bhaskar, the application show the degree of separation as follows.
1. Sameer > Aayushi > Bhaskar
2. Sameet > Kamalnath Sharma > Shanti Kumar Saha > Bhaskar
